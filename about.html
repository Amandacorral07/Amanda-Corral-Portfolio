          I've always had a goal in life to add value to the lives of others. As I was awaiting my results from nursing school I decided to pick up some new skills that would allow me to express my creativity. I stumbled upon SheCodes, a coding bootcamp specifically created for women. In January 2022 I started my SheCodes bootcamp journey. I created a schedule devoting at least ten hours a week to completing the bootcamp. Everyday after working as a home caregiver I'd spend at least two hours devoting my time to coding. Slowly but surely I found myself looking forward to learning all I could about coding. I had spent so many years of my life with my head down working towards becoming a nurse I hadn't had time to look up to see other options. I had a new found drive and purpose that added value to my life. I knew I was hooked.

           I am currently finishing my last section of the SheCodes bootcamp. I will be learning about React and how to make responsive websites using API's and Bootstrap. During my free-time I am honing in on my skills in HTML and CSS. I am also offering my services as a freelancer by creating website portfolios.
